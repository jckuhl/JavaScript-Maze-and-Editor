# MazeBuilder

Storytimes!  So I was bored, working on a game in Python and got distracted by a Computerphile video about solving mazes ([Maze Solving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI), not really trying to replicate that here though.), but before the guy in the video even started talking, I got to thinking about making a maze and solving it.  Before I knew it VSCode was open, I was typing and in about two hours I had a prototype going.

> [Here's](https://github.com/jckuhl/JavaScript-Maze) the repo for that.

But my maze solver had a few issues.  It entered an infinite loop if I swapped the start point and the end point and it was too difficult for me to redraw the maze over and over and over again to make sure it worked in any given condition for any sized maze (so long as it is layed out on a grid anyways.)

And here we are.  Here is a tool for building mazes, so I can see if my maze solving algorithm can solve them.

The things I do when I'm bored.

Below is how to install and set up.
